# counter-project
This is another project which aims to solidify my knowledge of manipulating the DOM. This project is simple: it is a single webpage which displays a number and 6 different buttons. The buttons do different things when clicked: one button increases the number by 1; another button decreases the number by 1; another button produces a random number between -1,000 and 1,000; another button tests whether the number displayed is a prime number; another button resets the number displayed back to 0; and, finally, the last button reveals some information on how to interact with the webpage.
